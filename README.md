# esphome-whereis
Presence detection implemented using esphome and leveraging the
Home assistant ibeacon feature in the Android app

I'll get around to more completely documenting this project.

For now, 
this code provides presence detection using the home assistant app
as a ble beacon. I intend that the code be inserted into 
your other esphome projects. The project is similar to the 
excellent esppresence project but allows esphome compatibility.

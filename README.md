Presence detection using esphome for Home assistant ibeacon

I'll get around to documenting this project.

For now, 
this code provides presence detection using the home assistant app
as a ble beacon. I intend that the code can be inserted into 
your other esphome projects. It's intended to operate similar to the 
excellent esppresence project.

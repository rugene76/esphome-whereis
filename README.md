# esphome-whereis
Presence detection implemented using esphome and leveraging the
Home assistant ibeacon feature in the Android app

I'll get around to documenting this project.

For now, 
this code provides presence detection using the home assistant app
as a ble beacon. I intend that the code can be inserted into 
your other esphome projects. It's intended to operate similar to the 
excellent esppresence project.
